#DataDiveSeattle2017

There is some data cleaning done to merge the project file and the donations files so that question about the locations of the donor and charity can be further explored.

There is also new columns created to label GivingTuesday and LastDay of the year to compare daily contributions during these days.

All the data used in this notebook are publicly available on donorschoose.org at https://research.donorschoose.org/t/download-opendata/33
